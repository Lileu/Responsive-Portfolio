                <p>Hi, I’m Lisa and welcome to my first bit of homework on my coding “journey”.</p>
                <p>So my background is in Finance/Economics and I’d been working at a Wealth Management company in
                    Finance
                    and Accounting roles for most of my career before I learned what a Business Analyst was and thought,
                    ‘That sounds like a pretty sweet gig, I could do that!’. So, I started getting involved in projects
                    and
                    managed to score some awesome business analysis secondments within Finance that gave me exposure to
                    things like data analysis/reporting, process improvement, workflow automation etc.. It was enough of
                    a
                    taster to affirm that IT was where I wanted to be but breaking into IT with that company was
                    difficult
                    for a number of reasons. </p>
                <p>I was approached about a Business Analyst role in IT for a smaller Wealth Management company two and
                    a
                    half years ago, and I just went for it. Best move ever (apart from moving from Perth). </p>
                <p>It’s been a massive learning curve moving from Finance to IT. The culture, values, personalities,
                    lingo,
                    way of working, way of thinking, are all so different from Finance. In my view, everything is an
                    upgrade
                    from what I used to do and I would never go back. Every day is different now. I get paid to solve
                    problems and build cool stuff with brilliant, supportive and hilarious kids. I’m learning new things
                    all
                    the time and it doesn’t stop. </p>
                <p>One side effect of working with awesome Devs is that knowing first-hand what they can do/make, and I
                    want
                    to do it too. Just as I felt when I realised I wanted to be a BA, I know it’s a sweet gig and I can
                    do
                    it. So here I am, challenged and loving it.</p>
