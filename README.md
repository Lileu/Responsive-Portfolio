# Basic-Portfolio
First homework assignment for the Monash University Coding Bootcamp (June 2019 cohort).

## Built with
1. HTML
2. CSS

## Stuff I used
* CSS properties: float, padding, margin, display, overflow, clear, text-align, pseudo-elements
* placeholder images from http://lorempixel.com/

## Stuff I learned
* adding structure to a page with HTML is easy
* positioning elements with CSS is hard
* lay down the html/content first, then build the style with css
* commit frequently
* Chrome inspect tool is my bff when it comes to troubleshooting and playing around with style elements
* pseudo classes can provide basic, handy interactive changes e.g hover, active, default etc.
